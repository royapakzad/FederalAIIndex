DHS-345,Touchless PreCheck Idintity Solution,Department of Homeland Security,Transportation Security Administration,"TSA is using Facial Comparison to verify a passenger’s identity at its security checkpoints using the CBP Traveler Verification Service (TVS). The TVS creates a secure biometric template of a passenger’s live facial image taken at the checkpoint and matches it against a gallery of templates of photos that the passenger previously provided to the government.
TVS is standard procedure for travelers entering or leaving the United States, however, TSA is leveraging this technology as an optional process for passengers traveling via certain airports who wish to further expedite their PreCheck screening process. This additional PreCheck feature is voluntary, and passengers may opt-out of the process at any time and instead choose the standard identity verification by a Transportation Security Officer (TSO).
To further enhance speed and security, TSA and CBP are also allowing airport and airline partners to request the use of TVS for identity verification. These partners purchase camera equipment in order to take voluntary photos of passengers at airport baggage drop and boarding locations for transmission to TVS. TVS then creates biometric templates of these photos and compares them against templates of existing DHS holdings as described above. This process streamlines passenger identity verification, increasing the speed of security checks while maintaining a high degree of safety for all passengers.",Operation and Maintenance,,,,Contracted,Yes,Facial Comparison,Developer; Agency Generated,,,,

As set forth in Section 451(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, Congress charged USCIS with administering the asylum program. USCIS, through its Asylum Division within the Refugee, Asylum & International Operations Directorate (RAIO), administers the affirmative asylum program to provide protection to qualified individuals in the United States who have suffered past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution in their country of origin, as outlined under Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1158 and Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 208. Generally, an individual not in removal proceedings may apply for asylum through the affirmative asylum process regardless of how the individual arrived in the United States or his or her current immigration status by filing Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. The ATA capability employs machine learning and data graphing techniques to identify plagiarism-based fraud in applications for asylum status and for the withholding of removal by scanning the digitized narrative sections of the associated forms and looking for common language patterns.",Operation and Maintenance,2019-01-25 00:00:00,2019-01-25 00:00:00,2019-10-01 00:00:00,Contracted,Yes,"Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP)",Agency Generated,Yes,,,
DHS-14,Biometrics Enrollment Tool (BET) Fingerprint Maximization,Department of Homeland Security,United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,"USCIS's Customer Profile Management Service (CPMS) serves as a person-centric repository of biometric and biographic information provided by applicants and petitioners (hereafter collectively referred to as “benefit requestors”) that have been issued a USCIS card evidencing the granting of an immigration related benefit (i.e., permanent residency, work authorization, or travel documents). The Biometrics Encounter Tool (BET) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Fingerprint Success Maximization Service center technicians can receive immediate feedback when a set of prints is likely to be rejected by the FBI by incorporating machine learning models into the BET application. The FBI will not disclose their quality grading criteria for fingerprints, leaving CPMS with the responsibility of determining quality to prevent unnecessary secondary encounters with applicants. Using even the simplest of models would catch 98% of rejected submissions, which could have potentially saved USCIS from scheduling 42,763 additional appointments in 2020. This would come at the cost of forcing recapture during 11% of encounters. This effort aims to maximize the number of successful FBI submissions while minimizing the number of fingerprint recaptures necessary. The BET team is currently working to integrate this model to provide better feedback to the user when a whole set of fingerprints is likely to result in an FBI rejection.

DHS-16,Evidence Classifier,Department of Homeland Security,United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,"USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Evidence Classifier. Until the introduction of the Evidence Classifier machine learning (ML) solution, those who are working cases and who are responsible for reviewing evidence documents would often have to sift through dozens, if not hundreds, of unlabeled pages to find one specific artifact — be that a green card, a birth certificate, or so on. To reduce the amount of adjudicative time spent on these repetitive tasks, a ML solution was built to systematically tag individual pages with some of the highest-volume, highest-impact evidence types. Calculated from September 28, 2021 , to May 20, 2022, the ML enhancements have saved around 24 million page scrolls, which amounts to approximately 13,348 hours saved, assuming it takes 2 seconds to review 1 page of evidence. This has nearly doubled cases with a 30-day adjudication rate from about 30% to 58%.

DHS-17,FDNS-DS NexGen,Department of Homeland Security,United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,"USCIS created the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) Directorate to strengthen the integrity of the nation’s immigration system and to ensure that immigration benefits are not granted to individuals who may pose a threat to national security and/or public safety. In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud.  In 2005, USCIS developed a case management system, the Fraud Detection and National Security – Data System (FDNS-DS),  to record, track, and manage the screening processes related to immigration applications, petitions, or requests with suspected or confirmed fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, and identify vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the legal immigration system.  In June 2023, FDNS-DS was replaced with a modernized case management system, FDNS-DS NexGen.  In the future, FDNS-DS NexGen may use artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) data from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. USCIS may also integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices. Fraud occurs in numerous ways; being able to discover and detect persons with multiple identities allows for more comprehensive investigations, reduces investigative cycle time, and improves performance. Future implementation of AI/ML techniques will speed up case and investigative processing by several magnitudes.

Also known as “green card” holders, LPRs are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States and are required to fill out Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Since there has been a considerable influx of green card applications, USCIS used a combination of exploratory data analysis to determine the most used categories for applicants submitting I-90's and machine learning to create predictions of workloads. As a follow-on, USCIS used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models on the I-90 form, which allowed the prediction of the total number of forms for a 2-year period. ARIMA is one of the easiest and effective machine learning algorithms to perform time series forecasting. This capability has been deployed in production for more than a year.

Our dataset includes biographic information (name, date of birth, Alien #, Social Security #, passport #, etc.) as well as biographic information (fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight, etc.) for model training and matching purposes. 

Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution/deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning, it is able to identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to pull together a full immigration history for an individual without time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems.

DHS-61,I-485 Family Matching,Department of Homeland Security,United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,"I-485 Family Matching is designed to create models to match family members to underlying I-485 petitions. The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State’s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the A-number. This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable. The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to more confidently create connections between petitioners and their families based on limited data.

Additionally, it will be able to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point.
