20,Course Deviation Identification for Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS),Department of Transportation,Federal Aviation Administration,Aviation Safety (AVS),"The Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS) program is developing a safety case for reduced separation standards between Performance Based Navigation (PBN) routes in terminal airspace. These new standards may enable deconfliction of airports in high-demand metropolitan areas, including the Northeast Corridor (NEC), North Texas, and Southern California. To build necessary collision risk models for the safety case, several models are needed, including one that describes the behavior of aircraft that fail to navigate the procedure correctly. These events are very rare and difficult to identify with standard data sources. Prior work has used Machine Learning to filter incident data to identify similar events on departure procedures.",Planned (not in production),NA,"Python in Jupyter Labs, ML, NLP",Yes,Agency Generated,No,NA,Yes,No,NA,Yes,Yes,"CEDAR MORs/EORs, Pilot Deviation Reports",false,Sensitive communications.

29,PHMSA Rule Making,Department of Transportation,Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA,PHMSA Office of Chief Counsel (PHC),"This PHMSA Rulemaking AI project is a proof of concept (POC) intended to test whether a generative Large Language Model (LLM), can augment the rulemaking process. The POC application will test the LLM’s ability to provide synopses and relevance/sentiment analysis of comments as they relate to a proposed rule. The POC is built on AWS Cloud services utilizing Azure OpenAI Generative LLM version 3.5 and is purpose built to be scalable. 

The input is unstructured data, ingested via API from regulations.gov. Data may include PDF, word, and other unformatted texts. These data are pre-processed and sent to the Azure OpenAI service. Queries generate outputs including synopsis, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction. Outputs are displayed in an interactive UI, supporting human rulemakers and lawyers. Application outputs include key points of the proposed rule, key points of a comment, whether key points of the comment support or oppose any specific key point of the rule, and whether a commenter provides a recommendation to revise the rule. Independent Validation and Verification will be performed on the output from the LLM to verify whether the outputs satisfy the goals and objectives and validate whether the outputs satisfy the stakeholders needs in the rulemaking process.",Planned (not in production),This is a pilot initiative,Azure OpenAI Generative LLM version 3.5,Yes,Agency Generated,Yes,NA,Yes,No,NA,Yes,Yes,Office Automation for Administrative Systems Support,false,
